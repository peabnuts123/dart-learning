# Dart learning

Learning about the Dart language by making some example applications in it.

## Set up the project

1. Make sure you have Dart [installed](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
1. Run `pub get` to download dependencies
1. Start the console app with `pub run bin/console_app.dart`
    - Or (because the package name is `console_app`, you can just run `pub run console_app`)
    - You can also run a dart file with `dart bin/console_app.dart`
1. Alternatively, you can run the web server app with `pub run bin/web_server.dart` (or `dart bin/web_server.dart`)

## Key points

  - [pub](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd) is a a CLI tool for managing dependencies in Dart projects
  - `pubspec.yaml` is the `package.json` of Dart projects i.e. manifest file
  - In order to add a dependency, you must _manually edit `pubspec.yaml`_ and add the package at the specified version range to the desired dependencies list
  - Dart comes with a linter. It's configured in `analysis_options.yaml`
  - Dart is a strongly-typed language like Java or C#. There are many in-built types like `List<T>` or `Map<String, int>`. See Dart's [Language tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour) for details of every feature the language has (many).
  - Dart has no `private` or `public` keywords - it instead uses a convention-based a approach. A leading underscore for private members e.g. `_handleError` will not be available outside of the file they are declared in.
  - [stagehand](https://pub.dev/packages/stagehand) is a CLI tool for generating Dart projects
  - Dart projects make a distinction between [Application packages](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/glossary#application-package) and [Library packages](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/glossary#library-package)
    - An **Application package** is a standalone application that you run e.g. some website you made or a CLI tool
    - A **Library package** is a package to be referenced by other packages i.e. it is intended to be a dependency - it won't have any `main()` function.
  - Dart projects have a bit of a peculiar structure to them
    - "Application packages" usually still have a "Library package" where most of your code will live i.e. your package will import and use itself
    - `bin/` Your executables will live here (for Application packages mostly)
    - `lib/` The source code for your "Library" (even if you are writing an Application package)
      - This will usually contain a top-level file that represents your Library's public API - it will export all the members from within your package
      - `lib/src/` The actual source code for your package
    - `example/` Examples of how to use your package
    - `test/` Tests
    - `doc/` Package documentation often generated by [dartdoc](https://github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc)
    - `tools/` For scripts and things
